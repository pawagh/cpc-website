There's no pressure to use the "right" programming language, but it definitely helps to have a few in your toolkit, since some languages lend themselves to solving certain problems. An example is how the wealth of string operations in Python allow the programmer to focus on the problem instead of implementing the string operation in another language. Some of the most popular languages used at [C++](https://www.learncpp.com/), [Python](https://www.learnpython.org/), and [Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/). Previously linked are some places from where you can learn these langauges. A good approach, especially when learning these langauges for a competitive programming purposes, is to solve problems with them so you build familiarity with how the langauge deals with data structures.
